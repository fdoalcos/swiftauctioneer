        <p class="text">I started my cs journey on early 2022 which I immediately fell in love with, Cs50 is fun and challenging lesson to partake, but it is more stressful and challenging. However Cs50 helped me learn a valuable lesson which is to never give up and take one step ahead each time. Cs50 not only teaches me the code but it teaches me the fundamentals that you will need to take on your journey or the tools to keep learning and learning because Cs is a long journey where it keeps growing and growing especially in this day and age. I am thankful that i stepped into in this wonderful world of programming and will explore more of this unending journey of programming.</p>
