# Title: AniPY
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUYwST0b30s
#### Description:
 *ANIPY is a search anime database which I used api or application programming interface which helped me grab database from an anime website.*
 *I made this because I like watching animes and stuff so it inspires me to do this app. The features of this web app is it helps you search your*
 *favorite Anime and go directly to the myanimelist which I grabbed the API from, ANIPY also can detect error in log in prompt*
 *and sign up prompt.*

## Files used:

#### anime.html
 *so this is the homepage of the Anipy where you can search for animes and check the popular animes,*
 *I have a lot of decisions to make for this, like deciding for the design and the proper way of fetching api.*

#### animeinfo.html
 *This one hasn't been used because it's better to prompt the user to the anime website which I grabbed the api from to get more details about the anime*

#### homepage.1.html
 *This one is for the developer nav which is also a copy from homepage problem set*


####  layout.html
 *This one is for the base of the html like what David taught us to do and use jinja syntax.*

####  login2.html
 *This one is for the log in prompt, it consist of error checking or flash messages*

####  rateme.html
 *This one also hasn't been used because I have a hard time of thinking if this was a good way to rate anime because the api already gave details about the*
 *ratings of the anime so it would be pointless if i will rate it again.*

####  signup.html
 *This one is for the sign up prompt, just like the log in, it checks for error and username validity.*

#### design choices and backend choices:

 *So I used flask, javascript to fetch some api and also check ideas from other web to get an idea of what design changes should I make to*
 *be able to have a good UI. I also learned about the basics of api to grab data anywhere or post data to somewhere I want.*

#### What languages and frameworks did I use:

 *I used some bootrsap elements for my design and used flask framework. The languages I used are python and javascript, and the static language I used are html and css.*


####  challenges and difficulties:

 *I've struggled a lot about this project beacuse i didn't know how to grab apis and some basic design pattern for css, but I've studied it and somehow did it. I;ve also feel*
 *bad about myself because it's just a simple website and others can make good project, but I will strive and do my best to be the best version of myself.*
